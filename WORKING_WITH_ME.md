# Working with me

This file gives you a rough outline of how I work with freelance clients. If you're looking for an overview of my work history, please see my main GitHub profile page here:

I currently work as a freelance/consulting software engineer, typically augmenting existing teams that are working directly on a product.

## Feature Development

## Productivity

Staying productive (especially when working remotely) is a challenge for all developers. Here's what I do so that I can put in produtive work every day:

* Planning.
* Time management and logging.
* Staying generally healthy. This includes maintaining a sensible sleep cycle, staying hydrated, lifting weights 4-5 times a week, and trying to stick to an overall healthy diet. While these things aren't directly related to programming, I find that the amount of time I can spend daily doing deep work decreases if I don't keep these fundamentals in check.

## Typical engagement structure and rates
