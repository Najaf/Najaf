# Working with me

This file gives you a rough outline of how I work with freelance clients. If you're looking for an overview of my work history, please see my main GitHub profile page here:

I currently work as a freelance/consulting software engineer, typically augmenting existing teams that are working directly on a product.

## Written communication

I write, a lot. On a development team this extends to status updates, wiki pages about the current system/proposed changes, task definitions in tello etc, and GitHub PR descriptions. My goal in doing so is to:

* Keep everyone up to date on what I'm doing, how I'm doing it, and why
* Leave a record of my thinking so future developers (especially myself) can understand my current decision-making process
* Ensure that if I get hit by a bus on any given day, other developers can take over any work I have in flight

## Feature Development

## Bug fixing

## Productivity

Staying productive (especially when working remotely) is a challenge for all developers. Here's what I do so that I can put in produtive work every day:

* Planning and communication. In order to keep forward momentum I try to break larger projects down into smaller pieces and communicate before, during, and after implementation.
* Time management and logging. I try to keep detailed logs of exactly what time I spend and how I spend it while doing development work. This helps to keep me focused and also makes providing status reports a great deal easier.
* Staying generally healthy. This includes maintaining a sensible sleep cycle, staying hydrated, lifting weights 4-5 times a week, and trying to stick to an overall healthy diet. While these things aren't directly related to programming, I find that the amount of time I can spend daily doing deep work drops if I don't keep these fundamentals in check.

## Typical engagement structure and rates

My average engagement with clients runs at a fixed number of hours per week (typically 10-15) week at a rate of $175/hour, invoiced monthly.
